Sometimes I get the feeling that I merely rehash concepts or opinions
that I seem to hear or read everywhere, all the time.  But then again,
many people I talk to have obviously never heard of these things.  So
probably it&rsquo;s just that the selection of things I read online, or think
about, or consider important, is heavily biased (even inside a
particular domain).  And quite likely, most people out there have their
own biased selection.  Here is a reminder of something I cherish,
garnished with a few links &#x2014; I would be sincerely happy if this piece
would help only a single reader to find something useful outside of
his/her usual track.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a> is a classic MIT
computer science textbook by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Abelson">Abelson</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerry_Sussman">Sussman</a>.  I am not so much
impressed by the remarkable (but nowhere near sufficient) impact it had
on CS curricula all over the world.  I am just baffled, time and again,
by the fact that it still contains some of the most profound things I
have read on computer science.<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
The text is written in a beautifully lucid style.  There are people who
consider the writing obfuscated.  My only explanation is that those
people either did not expect an actual theoretical work, or they might
think that a theoretical work has to delve into highly
mathematical/technical CS areas.  But keep in mind that this is an
introductory text.  If the &ldquo;science&rdquo; in &ldquo;computer science&rdquo; means
anything, it is this: Abstracting from petty details, carving out the
core ideas behind things and relating them to each other, getting closer
to a systematic and conceptual understanding.
</p>

<p>
The range of topics is amazing, effortlessly ranging all the way from
evaluation rules of simple procedures to writing compilers.  The book
shows that there are multiple genuinely different programming paradigms,
and implements and explains them (and their relations).<sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>  It
discusses and really(!) explains computational models, closures,
recursion, lambda expressions, symbolic data, concurrency, lazy
evaluation and much more.  Combined with the fact that the book came out
in 1984 (and all those things had already been implemented at least a
decade before that), it also shows that the new &ldquo;features&rdquo; that
so-called <i>industry-standard</i> languages in 2014 take pride in (or still
have not gotten right) are but a faint shadow of the really substantial
thoughts and contributions in the field (glossing over the 40-year
delay).
</p>

<p>
As a side note, I believe that a good part of the quality of the book is
owed to its choice of programming language, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)">Scheme</a>.  This does not
detract the slightest bit from the authors&rsquo; marvelous presentation.
Quite the opposite, they happen to be key figures in Scheme&rsquo;s
development themselves.  This is not a coincidence: They <i>wanted</i> a
language to clearly examine and demonstrate the <i>essence</i> of software
and computing.
</p>

<p>
What does it mean that they went on to write a CS text using that
language, and that this book appears as if it could hardly have been
written in any other language?  It means that Scheme is the natural
language to cleanly and precisely formulate all the ideas and concepts
we have about computing, in the most beautiful way possible.  How could
you <i>not</i> love such a language?
</p>

<p>
Why do I write this today?  Because far too late, I found <a href="http://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/index.xhtml">this</a> nice
current-tech rendition of the online text.
</p>

<p>
Do yourself a favor and have a look some time.  If you have a soft spot
for science and for <i>quality</i> and doing things right (as opposed to just
getting stuff done somehow), you will surely appreciate it.  It seems
many people feel this way, here&rsquo;s one apt <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/989164169?book_show_action=true&page=1">review</a>, and another <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R403HR4VL71K8/">one</a> by no
less than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Norvig">Peter Norvig</a>.<sup><a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Myself, I started with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB63C06FAF154F047">videos</a> of the charmingly old-school original
blackboard lectures, and frankly, I adore them.  They gave me a vivid
ideal of what the use of computers could look like in a
<a href="http://xkcd.com/297/">more&#x2026; civilized age</a>.
</p>

<p>
And I have not yet abandoned all hope.

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.1" name="fn.1" class="footnum" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> <p>Disclaimer: I say this lacking any
formal CS education, and I admit that I have not read the book in full,
and neither worked through the (many) exercises.</p></div>

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.2" name="fn.2" class="footnum" href="#fnr.2">2</a></sup> <p>It is <i>not</i>
a book about functional programming.  But it does give you a good idea
of what is great about functional programming, and why it is great, and
why and when you might still want to do things differently.</p></div>

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.3" name="fn.3" class="footnum" href="#fnr.3">3</a></sup> <p>Maybe to prove his point, some of the
ensuing comments not only get almost every aspect of this book wrong,
but actually manage to present the arguments for their dissenting
opinions in a spectacularly upside-down way.</p></div>
