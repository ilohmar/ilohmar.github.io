Some debates rear their ugly heads now and then, and I manage to avoid
them for some time, like, you know, grown-up style.  But at some point
somebody might just press all the right buttons at the right time, and
instead of him, <i>you</i> have to suffer the following rant if you so
choose&#x2026;

<h3 id="orge5f403a">The Issue</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge5f403a">
<p>
I am one of those people who think that monospaced on-screen text should
stick to a line length limit of 80 characters.  &ldquo;80&rdquo; is not some magic
number, just a traditional one for old-school terminal machines AFAIK.
Some might say 72 (to have some spare room), others say 78, it does not
matter to the topic at hand.  I was originally focusing on editing
source code, but will also share a few thoughts on other content below.
</p>

<h3 id="orgf099ccf">The Trigger: a Straw Man Argument</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf099ccf">
<blockquote>
<p>
We have large high-resolution monitors now, so why limit ourselves to
80 characters per line like in the seventies?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Being the browsing monkey that I am, it&rsquo;s sadly not the first time I
heard/read something like that.
</p>

<p>
Of course, nobody said that we should use an 80-char limit because of
lack of space on the screen.  While it might appear that this was the
reason for the limit 35 years ago (I doubt it, but have not cared enough
to investigate), that does not say anything about what&rsquo;s right today.
</p>

<p>
The argument for an 80-characters limit is about <i>readability</i> and text
recognition.  It is much harder to get a good overview from a quick
glance at wider lines, and it is much harder to follow text and line
breaks closely on wider lines.
</p>

<p>
Bigger screens with high resolution are a wonderful thing &#x2014; I do not
want to work on anything less than a 24&ldquo; 1920x1200 monitor these days
(better yet, two of them).  However, if the best use of that width that
you can think of is to use lines of 120 characters, or maybe 160
characters (yes, indeed), or as many as you see fit, you might want to
work on your imagination.
</p>

<p>
Some suggestions!  Maybe you like to keep a larger distance between you
and the screen, and you like text at &gt;= 24pt.  That is an honorable
thing to do.  Or you want to see <i>more</i> content on-screen &#x2014; my
personal use is to have several programs open side-by-side (use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager">tiling
window manager</a>), or several files within one program.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
But having a single file, and just letting lines extend to the right is
both, the worst possible use of your large screen (since, if there&rsquo;s
still hope, many lines will not be as wide), and a really bad choice for
text comprehension and/or cursory overview.
</p>

<h3 id="org5ecb3eb">On Prose</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5ecb3eb">
<p>
Writing prose is subject to the same thoughts (even more strongly in
some sense, since there is much less typographical expression of syntax
in most human languages compared to most programming languages, to my
knowledge).  Interestingly, however, the misconception that long lines
&ldquo;better exploit screen space&rdquo; has instead led some authors of technical
papers or research articles to add more weirdness on top.  To always
make &ldquo;best&rdquo; use of the horizontal space you happen to have available
right now, you &ldquo;should&rdquo; use so-called &ldquo;soft&rdquo; line-wrapping, where your
application breaks lines according to the width of your visual editing
window (instead of you manually breaking the lines, or the program doing
it at some fixed character count or visual width).
</p>

<p>
But that is turning things upside-down.  Using your screen space well,
as I tried to convince you, is about anything <b>but</b> making text as wide
as possible.  Therefore, I am a firm advocate of using hard line-breaks.
This should not be confused with the output that a word-processor might
produce, and which should, obviously, <i>not</i> adhere to such line breaks.
</p>

<p>
And at that point, one more terrible concept enters the stage: WYSIWYG
for word processors, almost eliminating the distinction between form and
content, and just begging for the misconceptions and fallacies described
above.  But actually, this might be for another post&#x2026;

<h3 id="org8afb932">One Last Thing</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8afb932">
<p>
Even in the best of programming languages, there are times when long
lines seem unavoidable, or the least of several evils.  So be it!  But
if you find yourself in this dilemma often, this could say something
about the tools you use (such as, mainly, the programming language), or
about the style of the code, or both.  Whatever the problem is, don&rsquo;t
try to push it beyond the 80-characters fence.

that, of course.  Even Visual Studio does that.  Ok, you made it, here&rsquo;s
your free on-the-side VS rant!  VS has managed to take this wonderful
idea, and, by some sick twist of fate, and courtesy of countless
Redmondian UI minions, came up with the most rigid, intrusive,
notoriously unhelpful, bug-ridden, ever-changing, ill-configurable way
to implement half a tiling window manager <i>inside</i> an IDE.  Morale: If
you don&rsquo;t trust your own operating system&rsquo;s window manager
to&#x2026; well&#x2026; manage your windows for you, go back to square one.  Bonus
points for spotting the obvious irony &#x2014; their thus-belittled own
operating system is called &ldquo;Windows&rdquo;.</div></div>
